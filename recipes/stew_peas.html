    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When you talk about Jamaican home cooking then this is one of the<br>
        first dishes that should cross your mind. Whether you like it the<br>
        traditional way, meaning the protein used is pig's tail or you have a <br>
        preference for salted beef, it really doesn't matter. When I think of a <br>
        meal that I want prepped at home this is it</p>
